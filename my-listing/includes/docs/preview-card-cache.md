# Preview Card Caching

Through this feature, a cached version of the preview card for every listing is created,
which can result in significantly faster load times in Explore page, Listing Feed widgets,
and other locations where preview cards are used.

The cards are updated automatically whenever the listing information is changed, but it may
occasionally be necessary to regenerate all cards on theme updates or when you've modified
the preview card template.
